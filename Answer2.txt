Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

Answer
Javascript:
Javascript is a programming language that is used to make the web pages interactive. It is used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM)
of the web page that makes the website dynamic and interactive. Javascript runs on the client side thus making it the most preferred language to run on the web. You can 
embed javascript inside HTML.
I would use Javascript to make the HTML page interactive. For example: if i have placed a button in my html code then i will use Javascript to write an event listener 
code to execute a function if someone clicks on that button.

HTML:
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language that helps to build the basic building blocks of the web page. It is used to define various elements of
a web page through the use of various tags and attributes that gives a definite structure to the web page. Unlike Javascript, HTML is used to create basic static web sites
without interactivity. It requires a web browser to render it.
I can use HTML to put a button or paragraph or headings in different style on the web page.
