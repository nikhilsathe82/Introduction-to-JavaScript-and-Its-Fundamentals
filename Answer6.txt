Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript

Answer:

It is very essential to give meaningful, proper, and descriptive names to variables in javascript for variety of reasons. 

Giving proper names makes it easier to understand the real intent for which you will be using the variable. Giving a proper variable name which is easier to understand
ensures that you can quickly grasp for what the variable will be used for. For example, a variable like customerName portrays that name of the customer will be stored
in that. Naming the variable in easy to understand manner proves helpful when storing the data in large databases where huge number of variables are being used.

Meaning variables names also increases the readability of the code as code becomes easier to understand quickly.

Naming the code in meaningful manner also helps you avoid making errors. For example, If you name 'a' variable z to hold a customer name and if you use this variable
'a' across multiples places. As your application expands, you will use this variable at multiple places and it is difficult to track for what purpose the code was used.
Instead if you use "customerName" as variable, it is easier to understand.

For example:

consider below example where we multiply a number by 2 and store the value in result. We do it by calling a function named multiplyByFive.

var number = 5;

function multiplyByFive(number){
 var result = number *5;

 console.log(`${number} multiplied by 5 is ${result}`);

};

multiplyByFive(6);
