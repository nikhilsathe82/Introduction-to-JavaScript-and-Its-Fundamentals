
The main purpose of declaring variables is to reserver some memory for any variable and assign some value to it. You must give a name to the variable and the type 
of data that will be stored in it.

The data type indicates what type of data you will be storing in the variable. Different ways to declare variables in javascript are by using let, const, and var
keywords.

Using let keyword you can declare variables that are block scope.

syntax:

let x = "Nikhil";
let x = 56;
