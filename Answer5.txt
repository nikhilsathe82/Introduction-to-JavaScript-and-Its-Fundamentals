Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.

Comments are used to provide information about the code that increase the readability of the code as  you can explain what a function or code and explain why it 
has been put, or what it will do. Comments exactly stop the execution of the code on the lines where they are inserted. Comments increases readability of the code as 
it makes it easier to understand by other developers. They are particularly important in documentation as you can explain about logic behind the code.

Type of comments:
1. Single line comments.
Single line comments starts with // symbol. All the text placed after // in that line will not be executed.

//This is a single line comment.


2. Multi-line comments:
Multiline comments allows you to insert text that can span multiple lines. It starts with /* and ends with */.

/* this is a multi line comment
spanning one or more lines */
