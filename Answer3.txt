Data types are nothing but categories of data that can computer can process. There are two types of data types in Javascript, that is primitive and non-primitive data types.

5 different Primitive Data Types are:
Primitive data types are basic forms of data types which allows you to store different types of data like numbers, string, boolean, big integer numbers etc.
Primitive data types are immutable that is you cannot alter their primitive values. you can reassign new values to variables created with primitive data types but 
you cannot alter their original values.

1. Number
You can store number or decimal form of data like 10, 30, 50. Various decimal forms of data that can be stored include 5.24, 6.5 etc.

syntax
var x = 10;

2. String
Allows you to store string type or characters data in a variable. for example, "Nikhil", 'Javascript'. Even if you mention numbers in quotes then those 
will be considered as string. For example "6" will be considered as string type data.

var name= "Nikhil"

3. Boolean
Allows you to store only two types of values like true or false. They have got vareity of uses in Javascript like to indicate whether a value condition is yes or no.

var boolean = true;

4. Null 
Allows you to store a value that indicates absense of any value. 

var name = null;

5. Undefined
Undefined data type is assigned to those variables that have been declared but no value is assigned to it.

var x; // x is declared but value is not assigned, hence it will have undefined data type.
